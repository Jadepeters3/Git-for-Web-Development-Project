## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is a function and Github is where you can apply that function.
3. Why do we create a branch? We create a branch to work on different versions of the same project.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? To transfer your changes onto Github and to request changes to Github repo.

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
git fetch can fetch from either a single named repository or URL, or from several repositories at once if <group> is given and there is a remotes.
git merge is to merge changes from one branch to another.
git pull gets data from your remote repo and updates the  current brach with that data.
7. What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is an event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.
